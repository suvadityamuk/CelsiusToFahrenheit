# Celsius To Fahrenheit

## To use
1.) Make sure you have Rust and Git installed in your computer.  
Clone the repo using the following command  
`git clone https://github.com/suvadityamuk/CelsiusToFahrenheit.git`  


2.) Assuming you already have Cargo, use  
```
cd CelsiusToFahrenheit
cargo run
```

3.) If you wish to run it directly, there is a binary executable present in `fahtocel/target/debug/fahtocel.exe`. Feel free to download the .zip of the repository, unzip and run just the executable.

## Information
This is a first 'Hello World-like' program for me in Rust.
